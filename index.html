                    I'm doing volunteer works with my family in non-profit organizations called Hopekids charity! I also loved to
                    read anykind of books, surfing the internet and cooking.

                    Me and my family spend a lot of time doing some activities outdoors like going for camping,hiking
                    an beaches. It makes me feel great being in this botcamp coding because i feel it helps me overcoming my fears and exploring different things, helps me to gain more
                    confident of myself, exploring more opportunity and it's also a
                    good start to learned more about coding/web developer industry.
